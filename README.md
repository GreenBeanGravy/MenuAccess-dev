# MenuAccess (name not finalized)
This is the development repo for MenuAccess; a Python project aimed at making it easier to add accessibility to menus inside of games without the need for modding or modding experience. MenuAccess will also be expanded in the future to also allow users to add accessibility to HUD elements, such as health bars, compasses, etc!
